        Internet has changed the world to a large extent as it has become possible to get products from distant lands apart from previous days when it was not possible.
        <br/><br/>
        Although we attempt to present our products in the best way as we can, but we cannot provide you the experience of viewing the products as you do in the physical stores. Hence we offer a 7 days return policy under which you can return the product if your expectations do not meet. After the time expires, no returns will be accepted.

                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks" ></span>
                In case you want to return the product then you will require following this -
            </div>
            <div class="txt_body">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Mention the details of your order and drop us an email at support@haastika.com with the reason for return.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Before returning the product, make sure that the product is not damaged. In case we get damaged products, then we will not refund the money.
                    </li>

                        All the expenses and charges of the process will be paid by the customer.
