The ethnic art were still one of the most respected ones there and is practiced by the artists primarily in Puri and Cuttack. The ethnic art form essentially consists of inscribing letters and artistic designs on palm-leaf,mostly cut into standard sizes and held together with two wooden plank covers stringed through a hole in the centre. To prepare the palm leaf, the unripe leaves of the palm tree are first cut and semidried. They are then buried in swamps for 4-5 days for seasoning and the dried in shade. These are then stitched or stringed together as per the need. At times they are stitched after the etching is complete. Etching is done within lines using an iron pen on leaf strips. A paste made of bean leaves, charcoal made of burnt coconut shells, til oil and turmeric is rubbed on the etching that highlights the figures. Colours are hardly used in this area, whatever are used as fillers and in very subdued tones. Vegetable and mineral colours are used for painting. The artists of palm leaf etchings capture the themes of mythological incidents, Gods and Goddesses figures complete with details of hair style and dress, animals, flowers and trees etc. Radha and Krishna, Durga, Ganesha and Saraswati are the most commonly used themes. Stories and incidents of Mahabharat, Ramayana and other epics are also etched. The paintings and drawings also present excellent scenes of nature.","enabled":true,"productAvailablility":"In stock","productImage":{"baseImagePath":"assets/images/products/362/HSIMG1/medium/medium.jpg","thumbImagePath":"assets/images/products/362/HSIMG1/thumb/thumb.jpg","largeImagePath":"assets/images/products/362/HSIMG1/large/large.jpg","extraLargeImagePath":"assets/images/products/362/HSIMG1/extraLarge/extraLarge.jpg","productImageId":1393,"imageName":"HSIMG1"},"productCategory":{"categoryName":"Ken Bambo Palmleaf Painting","categoryId":49,"categoryPartNumber":"HSCH049"},"productCurrency":{"productCurrencyId":1,"productCurrencyCode":"INR"},"productDetailsURL":"/product/HSPP362","priceOptions":[{"countryName":"India","currencyCode":"INR","currencyId":1,"currencySymbol":"INR","price":316.25},{"countryName":"United States","currencyCode":"USD","currencyId":2,"currencySymbol":"$","price":4.65},{"countryName":"Europe","currencyCode":"EUR","currencyId":3,"currencySymbol":"GBP","price":4.42}],"productSpecification":{"height":"20 cm","weight":"100 gm","width":"15 cm","depth":"5 cm","usageDetails":"This craft can be used for home and wall decoration, gifting personal and corporate.","productSpecificationId":411},"productImageGallery":[{"baseImagePath":"assets/images/products/362/HSIMG1/medium/medium.jpg","thumbImagePath":"assets/images/products/362/HSIMG1/thumb/thumb.jpg","largeImagePath":"assets/images/products/362/HSIMG1/large/large.jpg","extraLargeImagePath":"assets/images/products/362/HSIMG1/extraLarge/extraLarge.jpg","productImageId":1393,"imageName":"HSIMG1"}]},{"productId":355,"productPartNumber":"HSPP355","productName":"Ken photo palmleaf painting HSGIFT039","productDescription":"One of the most ancient crafts of the world, etching and paintings on the palm leaf still thrives in the state of Orissa in India.

A lot of household and decorative items are made using dried grass which becomes yellow and golden in colour. The grass is made of 'Khus Khus' stem. It is sturdy and can be bent to any shape to be turned into items of household use like baskets, boxes, mats, coasters, pen holders, wall hangings etc.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size and intricacy, each of the handicraft items takes anywhere between a day to a month to complete. Sometimes a little colour is added to the grass to create interest in the design. But generally the natural golden sheen of the dried grass itself makes it look very bright and attractive.\r\n\r\nThis craft was widely practiced in Orissa till about 40-50 years back as a lot of utility stuff was made using this craft. But as is the story everywhere, due to industrialization this craft also became almost extinct within no time. It was then left to the effort of some individuals and NGO's who tried to revive this craft by giving it a wider market. This craft has been saved, but only just. Only a few pockets like Jajanga village near Kendrapada and Jajapur, in Orissa now practice this craft. Though it is still living, but its future is uncertain, so give it a chance to be widly marketed.","categoryPartNumber":"HSCH013","categoryMenuImagePath":"","categoryTileImagePath":"assets/images/products/tile/IMG_3554.jpg","categoryBannerImagePath":"assets/images/categories/goldenGrass/Golden grass.png","categoryCSSClass":null,"categoryId":13,"enabled":true,"rootCategory":{"categoryId":2,"categoryName":"Home Decor"},"productsList":[{"productId":83,"productPartNumber":null,"productName":"HSGG012","productDescription":"","enabled":false,"productAvailablility":"Out of stock","productImage":{"baseImagePath":"assets/images/products/1/HSIMG1/medium/medium.jpg","thumbImagePath":"assets/images/products/1/HSIMG1/thumb/thumb.jpg","largeImagePath":"assets/images/products/1/HSIMG1/large/large.jpg","extraLargeImagePath":"assets/images/products/1/HSIMG1/extraLarge/extraLarge.jpg","productImageId":1027,"imageName":"HSIMG1"},"productCategory":{"categoryName":"Golden Grass","categoryId":13,"categoryPartNumber":"HSCH013"},"productCurrency":{"productCurrencyId":1,"productCurrencyCode":"INR"},"productDetailsURL":"/product/HSPP083","priceOptions":[{"countryName":"India","currencyCode":"INR","currencyId":1,"currencySymbol":"INR","price":180.00},{"countryName":"United States","currencyCode":"USD","currencyId":2,"currencySymbol":"$","price":2.65},{"countryName":"Europe","currencyCode":"EUR","currencyId":3,"currencySymbol":"GBP","price":2.52}],"productSpecification":{"height":"6.00","weight":"40.00","width":"13.00","depth":"0.00","usageDetails":"Hat(Midium)","productSpecificationId":83},"productImageGallery":[]},{"productId":89,"productPartNumber":"HSPP089","productName":"Golden Grass Round Box-HSGG018","productDescription":"The village artisan in rural areas of Odisha make best use of the humblstraw materials like grass tansforming them in to beautiful things of use.

Animal figurines of bulls, elephants and horses are also elegantly molded in very natural strong forms.\r\n\r\n \r\nTerracotta is an art form so universal in its identity, yet emblazoned with the distinct imprint of the native soil. The art of kiln burnt pottery wares provides the perfect counterfoil to the amazing legacy of stone sculpture. Terracotta artifacts demand a very high degree of artistic application and motivation. The polish on the final figure conceals an enormous volume of tireless toil and watchful attention. The terracotta products of the State have attracted admiration of art-lovers all over the country. The artisans prepare the head portion and then the body portion and finally join the parts with clean finishing. These are then allowed to dry and the objects are put to fire in the kiln.
