               "productDescription":"Golden grass craft is a nature lover's delight. A lot of household and decorative items are made using dried grass which becomes yellow and golden in colour. The grass is made of 'Khus Khus' stem. It is sturdy and can be bent to any shape to be turned into items of household use like baskets, boxes, mats, coasters, pen holders, wall hangings etc.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size and intricacy, each of the handicraft items takes anywhere between a day to a month to complete. Sometimes a little colour is added to the grass to create interest in the design. But generally the natural golden sheen of the dried grass itself makes it look very bright and attractive.\r\n\r\nThis craft was widely practiced in Orissa till about 40-50 years back as a lot of utility stuff was made using this craft. But as is the story everywhere, due to industrialization this craft also became almost extinct within no time. It was then left to the effort of some individuals and NGO's who tried to revive this craft by giving it a wider market. This craft has been saved, but only just. Only a few pockets like Jajanga village near Kendrapada and Jajapur, in Orissa now practice this craft. Though it is still living, but its future is uncertain, so give it a chance to be widly marketed",

Popular items are roof tiles and utensils such as plates, khullars or the earthen tea cups, jars and many other kitchen items. Artists prepare many items most of which they outline and highlight with colours. However, in most cases the finished is left with the natural terracotta colour. Animal figurines of bulls, elephants and horses are also elegantly molded in very natural strong forms.\r\n\r\n \r\nTerracotta is an art form so universal in its identity, yet emblazoned with the distinct imprint of the native soil. The art of kiln burnt pottery wares provides the perfect counterfoil to the amazing legacy of stone sculpture. Terracotta artifacts demand a very high degree of artistic application and motivation. The polish on the final figure conceals an enormous volume of tireless toil and watchful attention. The terracotta products of the State have attracted admiration of art-lovers all over the country. The artisans prepare the head portion and then the body portion and finally join the parts with clean finishing. These are then allowed to dry and the objects are put to fire in the kiln. These products are then polished with specific touch. The products are brown or black in colour. Now a days, some artisans also paint the articles with the chosen colour of the customers",
