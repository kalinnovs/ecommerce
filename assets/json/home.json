One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro.[1] The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated.[2] The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in China, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, Central America and other places.",

A lot of household and decorative items are made using dried grass which becomes yellow and golden in colour. The grass is made of 'Khus Khus' stem. It is sturdy and can be bent to any shape to be turned into items of household use like baskets, boxes, mats, coasters, pen holders, wall hangings etc.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size and intricacy, each of the handicraft items takes anywhere between a day to a month to complete. Sometimes a little colour is added to the grass to create interest in the design. But generally the natural golden sheen of the dried grass itself makes it look very bright and attractive.\r\n\r\nThis craft was widely practiced in Orissa till about 40-50 years back as a lot of utility stuff was made using this craft. But as is the story everywhere, due to industrialization this craft also became almost extinct within no time. It was then left to the effort of some individuals and NGO's who tried to revive this craft by giving it a wider market. This craft has been saved, but only just. Only a few pockets like Jajanga village near Kendrapada and Jajapur, in Orissa now practice this craft. Though it is still living, but its future is uncertain, so give it a chance to be widly marketed.",

Called Talapatrachitras there, the art has reached new heights there. Once the palm leaf etchings are treasured decorations of all Indian home.\r\nThe art originated when written communication began. Messages and manuscripts were written on the palm leaf to be disseminated. Gradually the trend to decorate the text with images began and it became an art in itself. The ethnic art were still one of the most respected ones there and is practiced by the artists primarily in Puri and Cuttack.\r\nThe ethnic art form essentially consists of inscribing letters and artistic designs on palm-leaf, mostly cut into standard sizes and held together with two wooden plank covers stringed through a hole in the center. To prepare the palm leaf, the unripe leaves of the palm tree are first cut and semidried. They are then buried in swamps for 4-5 days for seasoning and the dried in shade. These are then stitched or stringed together as per the need. At times they are stitched after the etching is complete. \r\nEtching is done within lines using an iron pen on leaf strips. A paste made of bean leaves, charcoal made of burnt coconut shells, til oil and turmeric is rubbed on the etching that highlights the figures. Colours are hardly used in this area, whatever are used as fillers and in very subdued tones. Vegetable and mineral colors are used for painting.\r\n\r\nThe artists of palm leaf etchings capture the themes of mythological incidents, Gods and Goddesses figures complete with details of hair style and dress, animals, flowers and trees etc. Radha and Krishna, Durga, Ganesha and Saraswati are the most commonly used themes. Stories and incidents of Mahabharat, Ramayana and other epics are also etched. The paintings and drawings also present excellent scenes of nature.\r\n\r\nThe art can be configured basedon customer requirements.\r\n",

Popular items are roof tiles and utensils such as plates, khullars or the earthen tea cups, jars and many other kitchen items. Artists prepare many items most of which they outline and highlight with colours. However, in most cases the finished is left with the natural terracotta colour. Animal figurines of bulls, elephants and horses are also elegantly molded in very natural strong forms.\r\n\r\n \r\nTerracotta is an art form so universal in its identity, yet emblazoned with the distinct imprint of the native soil. The art of kiln burnt pottery wares provides the perfect counterfoil to the amazing legacy of stone sculpture. Terracotta artifacts demand a very high degree of artistic application and motivation. The polish on the final figure conceals an enormous volume of tireless toil and watchful attention. The terracotta products of the State have attracted admiration of art-lovers all over the country. The artisans prepare the head portion and then the body portion and finally join the parts with clean finishing. These are then allowed to dry and the objects are put to fire in the kiln. These products are then polished with specific touch. The products are brown or black in colour. Now a days, some artisans also paint the articles with the chosen colour of the customers.",

The art of kiln burnt pottery wares provides the perfect counterfoil to the amazing legacy of stone sculpture. Terracotta artifacts demand a very high degree of artistic application and motivation. The polish on the final figure conceals an enormous volume of tireless toil and watchful attention. The terracotta products of the State have attracted admiration of art-lovers all over the country. The artisans prepare the head portion and then the body portion and finally join the parts with clean finishing. These are then allowed to dry and the objects are put to fire in the kiln. These products are then polished with specific touch. The products are brown or black in colour. Now a days, some artisans also paint the articles with the chosen colour of the customers. Barapalli in Bargarh district, Nuagaon in Khurda district, Batahaladharpur in Keonjhar district, Lunuka in Jagatsinghpur district, Sorispadar in Rayagada, Kusumi in Poraput, Kuibahal-Silati in Subarnpur district, Puintala 7 Baghapalli of Bolangir district are famous for terracotta crafts.",

The art of kiln burnt pottery wares provides the perfect counterfoil to the amazing legacy of stone sculpture. Terracotta artifacts demand a very high degree of artistic application and motivation. The polish on the final figure conceals an enormous volume of tireless toil and watchful attention. The terracotta products of the State have attracted admiration of art-lovers all over the country. The artisans prepare the head portion and then the body portion and finally join the parts with clean finishing. These are then allowed to dry and the objects are put to fire in the kiln. These products are then polished with specific touch. The products are brown or black in colour. Now a days, some artisans also paint the articles with the chosen colour of the customers. Barapalli in Bargarh district, Nuagaon in Khurda district, Batahaladharpur in Keonjhar district, Lunuka in Jagatsinghpur district, Sorispadar in Rayagada, Kusumi in Poraput, Kuibahal-Silati in Subarnpur district, Puintala 7 Baghapalli of Bolangir district are famous for terracotta crafts.",

Masks, hand bags, toys are produced out of specially made papers in Orissa that are not only beautiful but strong and durable as well.\nOrissa has a history of folk theatre also known as Jatra in local parlance. The characters of these Jatras are made of wood and vividly painted. They are dressed according to the characters played by them and are controlled by strings. Based on the characterizations, masks are used by the artists. These masks are made of wood, sholapith and papiermache. This has given rise to the art of making masks from special paper. Most artisans for this craft are located in and around Puri.\nAn elaborate procedure is followed to make papers for these items. Paper, waste cloth and different kinds of natural fibers are soaked and beaten into pulp. They are then mixed with a variety of seeds and gums for strength and as protection from termites. Special clays and bio-wastes are added for body and reinforcement. The entire process results in a medium so malleable that it requires skill to be molded into countless forms. Items like masks, toys and caps generate a lot of interest in the market.",

Masks, hand bags, toys are produced out of specially made papers in Orissa that are not only beautiful but strong and durable as well.\nOrissa has a history of folk theatre also known as Jatra in local parlance. The characters of these Jatras are made of wood and vividly painted. They are dressed according to the characters played by them and are controlled by strings. Based on the characterizations, masks are used by the artists. These masks are made of wood, sholapith and papiermache. This has given rise to the art of making masks from special paper. Most artisans for this craft are located in and around Puri.\nAn elaborate procedure is followed to make papers for these items. Paper, waste cloth and different kinds of natural fibers are soaked and beaten into pulp. They are then mixed with a variety of seeds and gums for strength and as protection from termites. Special clays and bio-wastes are added for body and reinforcement. The entire process results in a medium so malleable that it requires skill to be molded into countless forms. Items like masks, toys and caps generate a lot of interest in the market.",
